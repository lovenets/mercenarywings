Version 1.4
- Fixed and improved some tooltips.
- Added an active target property to the missile controller. This target, if set, will always be the first the missile will try to reach. The normal target will be used if this is null.
  This can be used to control the path of the missile. Even waypoint systems should be easy to do now, while still maintaining the original target.
- Added OnTargetChange event to the missile controller. This event can notify any listening scripts whenever the missiles target has been changed.
- Added OnActiveTargetChange event to the missile controller. This event can notify any listening scripts whenever the missiles active target has been changed.
- Updated and slightly improved readme file.
- Added the AltitudeControl script which you can find in the actions folder and namespace. However, this is technically not the same as other options, since it's not triggerable.
- Added a new scene to showcase the new script.

Version 1.3
- New action script: Disperse.cs
	- This script introduces some random rotation, which can be used to create a dispersion effect.
	- Look at the new demo to see how it works.

Version 1.2
- Now compatible with Unity 4.6 & 5.0
- Reworked lots of things:
	- Every class now has tooltips.
	- Completely redone demo scene.
	- Every action script is now also a trigger.
	- Redone ReadMe.
	- The Explode action script now has a variable to introduce a delay to the destruction of the gameobject.
	- Added more comments to some scripts.
- Added the new SpawnSwarm action script.
	- When triggered this script will spawn a number of prefabs around the missile in a radial pattern.
- Added five new prefabs which all use the new SpawnSwarm script to show you how it works.

Version 1.1
- Added fuel feature
- Added the new SearchForNewTarget action script.
	- This script is a trigger and an action at the same time.
	- When triggered it will search for a new target within a certain range.
	- If it can not find a target it will fire an event itself, which you can use the same way as any other trigger script.
